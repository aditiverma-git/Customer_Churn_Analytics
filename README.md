Customer Churn Prediction on non-contractual ecommerce data
This study is a comprehensive approach to predict customer churn in the example of an e-commerce retail store operating in Brazil. The approach consists of three stages in which we combine and use different datasets: orders, products, reviews, customer, sellers, price, and geolocations. At the pre-processing stage, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand how the data is behaving and try to capture the understanding of customer behaviour. We also use K-means clustering to do the customer segmentation and assess the three main aspects to define the churn: Frequency, Recency and Monetary Clusters. At the modelling stage, we apply machine learning techniques like logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and XGB. The quality of models is verified with area-under-curve and lift metrics.
